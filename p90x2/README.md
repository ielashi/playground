Finished P90X and now trying out P90X2.

## Progress: 6 / 90

## Journal

### Week 4

* **Day 1: 2021.07.08**
  Chest, back, balance + X2 Ab Ripper. Feels really good to do these workouts again. Felt slight ache in my shoulder, so I will modify plyo pushup exercises. I also chose not to do the bonus rounds so I don't strain myself too much initially.

Long break...

### Week 3

* **Day 1: 2021.05.10**
  X2 Core.

### Week 2

Week 1 had a lot of procrastination. Time to get things back on track.

* **Day 6: 2021.05.09**
  Balance + Power

* **Day 5: 2021.05.07**
  Yoga X (first half). I prefer Yoga X to X2 Yoga.

* **Day 4: 2021.05.05**
  X2 Total Body + X2 Ab Ripper

* **Day 3: 2021.05.04**
  Rest

* **Day 2: 2021.05.03**
  Really enjoyed it.

* **Day 1: 2021.05.02**
  X2 Core. Enjoyed it more now that I have stability + med balls.

### Week 1

* **Day 7: 2021.04.30**
  Rest

* **Day 6: 2021.04.29**
