# P90X

P90X is old but gold. As of today (January 3rd, 2021) I am deciding to actually go through the classic version of P90X.



## Progress: 3 / 90

## Notes

### Day 3: 2021.01.05

Did shoulders + arms. I did well, although changing bands has been taking time, but I'm sure it'll get faster as I get more used to them. I didn't do the bonus round in the exercises. Also, I didn't do Ab Ripper X as my legs were feeling too sore.

### Day 2: 2021.01.04

Felt quite sore - good thing I didn't stress myself too much yesterday. I did the plyometrics workout - very fun! It's hard to measure progress, but I guess I did about 60-70% of the reps. I'm sure that will improve over time.

### Day 1: 2021.01.03
Did the chest and back workout followed by ab ripper x. I deliberately underperformed in the chest & back so that I won't be too sore the next day. My abs have clearly regressed - I did maybe half of the reps in the exercises as it was too intense.
