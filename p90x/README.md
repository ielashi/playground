# P90X

P90X is old but gold. As of today (January 3rd, 2021) I am deciding to actually go through the classic version of P90X.

## Progress: 8 / 90

Workout progress is updated in the sheet in this folder.

## Notes

### Week 2

* **Day 1: 2021.01.10**
  Did the chest and back workout followed by ab ripper x. I generally performed better than last week, although I want to avoid falling for the numbers game and sacrifice quality. It suffices to say that I feel really good.

### Week 1

* **Day 7: 2021.01.09**
  Tried X Stretch for the first time. Refreshing.

* **Day 6: 2021.01.08**
  I used to do KenpoX occasionally last year for my amusement - such a fun and entertaining workout. I need to work on my back and side kicks. I am not sure I have good form.

* **Day 5: 2021.01.07**
  Legs & Back. Progress recorded on the sheet.

* **Day 4: 2021.01.06**
  First time doing Yoga X. I generally did well but struggled a bit with some of the balance poses (e.g. half moon)

* **Day 3: 2021.01.05**
  Did shoulders + arms. I did well, although changing bands has been taking time, but I'm sure it'll get faster as I get more used to them. I didn't do the bonus round in the exercises. Also, I didn't do Ab Ripper X as my legs were feeling too sore.

* **Day 2: 2021.01.04**
  Felt quite sore - good thing I didn't stress myself too much yesterday. I did the plyometrics workout - very fun! It's hard to measure progress, but I guess I did about 60-70% of the reps. I'm sure that will improve over time.

* **Day 1: 2021.01.03**
  Did the chest and back workout followed by ab ripper x. I deliberately underperformed in the chest & back so that I won't be too sore the next day. My abs have clearly regressed - I did maybe half of the reps in the exercises as it was too intense.
