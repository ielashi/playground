* **Day 7: 2021.02.21**
  Snowshoe hike + X Stretch

* **Day 6: 2021.02.20**
  Did _not_ do Kenpo. Was feeling very tired and stiff, and was going to do a snow hike the next day.

* **Day 5: 2021.02.19**
  Legs and back + ab ripper x. My abs feel very sore. They certainly need a break. Good thing I have a rest week coming up.
  
* **Day 4: 2021.02.18**

### Week 6
* **Day 7: 2021.02.14**
  Did half of the X stretch. Didn't feel like finishing it (it's optional anyways).
  
* **2021.02.13**
  Went skiing.
  
* **Day 6: 2021.02.12**
  Did half of Kenpo X. Don't want to over do it since I'm skiing tomorrow.

* **Day 1: 2021.02.07**
  Chest, Shoulders & Triceps + Ab Ripper X

### Week 5
* **Day 7: 2021.01.30**
  X Stretch.

* **Day 6: 2021.01.29**
  Yoga X. Good progress.
  
* **Day 5: 2021.02.04**
  Lega and back. Again made the mistake of eating before the workout. never again. I was invited at my neighbour's where I was given some Austrian dessert. It was ok, but now my stomach doesn't feel great so I'll skip ab ripper today.
  
* **Day 4: 2021.02.03**
  Yoga X. My half moons are getting better, also feeling that my hamstrings are getting more flexible.

* **Day 3: 2021.02.02**

  Did Back & Biceps + Ab Ripper. Doing better on Ab Ripper.

* **Day 2: 2021.01.31**
  Plyometrics. Love this workout.

* **Day 1: 2021.01.31**

  Chest, Shoulders & Triceps + Ab Ripper X. I went a little easy on the first workout.

### Week 4 (rest week)

* **Day 7: 2021.01.30**

  X Stretch as Pascal's home in Merligen.

* **Day 6: 2021.01.29**

  Was supposed to do Yoga X, but decided to skip it because my shoulder wasn't feeling very good.
  
* **Day 5: 2021.01.28**

  Core synergistics. Enjoyed it much more than the first time. I was on the verge of not working out because I "wasn't feeling it". I'm glad I did.

* **Day 4: 2021.01.27**

  Stretch X

* **Day 3: 2021.01.26**

  Kenpo X. As usual, it's fun.

* **Day 2: 2021.01.25**

  Tried core synergistics for the first time. I didn't enjoy it very much to be honest, but also I just wasn't feeling very energetic because I ate not long before the exercise.

* **Day 1: 2021.01.24**
  Yoga X. My balance poses (e.g. half moon) are getting better. Also noticing an improvement in my hamstring stretches.

### Week 3
* **Day 7: 2021.01.23**
  Did both Stretch X and Kenpo X. Caught up with the original schedule.

* **Day 6: 2021.01.22**
  Legs + Back + AbRipper. This time around I did slightly less reps in pull-ups, but with cleaner form and an isometric hold.

* **Day 5: 2021.01.21**
  Rested. Felt like I needed a break.

* **Day 4: 2021.01.20**
  Yoga X. Getting deeper into the poses. Still struggling with some of the more advanced balancing exercises like half moon. Hamstrings are noticeably more flexible than last time (can reach my toes in single-leg stretches).

* **Day 3: 2021.01.19**
  Shoulder + arms + ab ripper. I didn't do the bonus round unfortunately as I was very short on time. Better performance than last week.

* **Day 2: 2021.01.18**
  Plyometrics. Felt energetic and did well.

* **Day 1: 2021.01.17**
  Chest & Back + Ab Ripper. Felt a lot of energy and performed much better than last week. Even though I really enjoy this workout, I want to stress more on technique as opposed to executing many reps. I've noticed that, as I was moving quickly to do more pushups or more pullups, there would be some slight kepping. I'll be more mindful of that next time.

### Week 2

* **Day 7: 2021.01.16**
  Today was supposed to be my rest day, but I ended up doing KenpoX to catch up.

* **Day 6: 2021.01.15**
  Sadly, I couldn't do KenpoX that day because I had work followed by friends coming over for dinner. Sad =(

* **Day 5: 2021.01.14**
  Legs and back. I performed a little better than last week, but generally felt that I had really low energy. I think it's because I ate not too long before the workout - never again!

* **Day 4: 2021.01.13**
  YogaX. Feeling better and more stable than last time, but still need work on the balances. It'll take time, but it's a very nice before-bed workout.

* **Day 3: 2021.01.12**
  Shoulders + arms. This time I did the bonus round, and it felt good. I used higher-resistance bands than last time, but I think I should experiment more with loop sizes rather than changing bands since that takes up a lot of time. I unfortunately forgot to do Ab Ripper this time.

* **Day 2: 2021.01.11**
  Really enjoyed the plyometrics exercise. I am less sore than last week and there's definitely an improvement.

* **Day 1: 2021.01.10**
  Did the chest and back workout followed by ab ripper x. I generally performed better than last week, although I want to avoid falling for the numbers game and sacrifice quality. It suffices to say that I feel really good.

### Week 1

* **Day 7: 2021.01.09**
  Tried X Stretch for the first time. Refreshing.

* **Day 6: 2021.01.08**
  I used to do KenpoX occasionally last year for my amusement - such a fun and entertaining workout. I need to work on my back and side kicks. I am not sure I have good form.

* **Day 5: 2021.01.07**
  Legs & Back. Progress recorded on the sheet.

* **Day 4: 2021.01.06**
  First time doing Yoga X. I generally did well but struggled a bit with some of the balance poses (e.g. half moon)

* **Day 3: 2021.01.05**
  Did shoulders + arms. I did well, although changing bands has been taking time, but I'm sure it'll get faster as I get more used to them. I didn't do the bonus round in the exercises. Also, I didn't do Ab Ripper X as my legs were feeling too sore.

* **Day 2: 2021.01.04**
  Felt quite sore - good thing I didn't stress myself too much yesterday. I did the plyometrics workout - very fun! It's hard to measure progress, but I guess I did about 60-70% of the reps. I'm sure that will improve over time.

* **Day 1: 2021.01.03**
  Did the chest and back workout followed by ab ripper x. I deliberately underperformed in the chest & back so that I won't be too sore the next day. My abs have clearly regressed - I did maybe half of the reps in the exercises as it was too intense.
